# L5bLocationCode

### Premise: 
Built are scripts used to characterize encoding and test touch location decoding using single neurons from L5b neurons recorded in mouse S1. For summary of all results and findings using this script see Cheung et al., 2019b. For a complete description of the behavioral paradigm during neural recordings refer to Cheung et al., 2019a. 

### Requirements: 
All code is built and tested on MATLAB 2018b. 
glmnet from Qian and Hastie 2013 : https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet_matlab/
